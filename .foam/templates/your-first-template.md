# Foam Note Templates

Foam includes note templates! 
This allows you to easily create notes that have similar structure without having to use copy/paste :)

can:
- add variables to the newly created note
- add tabstop to automatically navigate to the key parts of the note, just like a form
Below you can see an example showing a todo list and a timestamp.

## Todo List

1. ${1:First tabstop}
2. ${2:A second tabstop}
3. ${3:A third tabstop}

Note Created: ${CURRENT_YEAR}-${CURRENT_MONTH}-${CURRENT_DATE}

Enjoy!
